										<p>We wanted to expand and update our kitchen/dining area. This involved tearing down a wall, re-doing the concrete side patio, reconfiguring some of the cabinets and adding others, new floors, new quartz counter tops, tumbled tile backsplash, adding new windows and a lovely custom built-in window seat with storage, light fixtures etc. I made a rough design plan and we interviewed several contractors eventually choosing Eric Barry of EB homes. We had heard horror stories of renovations gone horribly awry, and were hoping for the best. Well, that's exactly what we got! Eric was an absolute pleasure to work with along with the other trades he chose for the job. He was very patient with me and pointed out any issues that might occur as a result of my design choices. I'm a pretty thorough and organized person and was very pleased with his ability to co-ordinate the many aspects of the construction and finish in less time than one would expect. This while always being on time and with a smile on his face. The result was fantastic and all in about 6 weeks! It's my pleasure to very, very highly recommend this company.</p>
